                    This course is the first one at our program that touches front-end devlopment.
                    we haven't even yet learned anything about web-devlopment, which make this course 
                    very interessting for us. 
                </p> 
                <p>
                    It's exciting how with doing simple thing we see how much the styles changes in CSS, and the html was even easier 
                    than expected.

                    we hade yet only one lecture at campus and the teacher was a great one. 
                    we look forward the cuntinus of this cours and have some challengs
                    with the upcoming assignments. 
                </p>   
                <p>
                    As far as until now the first assignment was a thoughtful one that made me use HTML and CSS for the 
                    first time in this scale.
                    I hade use it before, but done much less than this. If it would be up to me I would say that this time 
                    was the first time I realy used this tools to build a web-site.
